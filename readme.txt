Under "Settings" you can import and export maps and markers.

In order to create your Google Map, simply click on "Add Maps" in your left menu. When Google Maps page loads, set the height, width and map name (map width can set in percent and in pixels). To add a marker to your Google Map click on button "Add marker". Here you can set marker configuration. 

It is already possible to add the name of the marker, the marker icon, set the address marker, and a description of the marker. Also in the description of the marker can be attached images, text, links. Description token support html-code. Important! One marker may be used on a single map. You can not use 1 marker on two different maps.

Copy and paste the shortcode into your post or page and Google Maps Easy will automatically create the map on your page using the settings you chose above.
